## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Dr Frazer Noble and I'm a lecturer at Massey University, Auckland's School of Engineering and Advanced Technology.

In this repository, I've put together a series of tutorials, worksheets, and videos, with the aim to helping you get started with using the Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV).

## Tools

I have used the following tools to develop the tutorials:

1. Microsoft's Windows 10.

2. Microsoft's Visual Studio 2017. Download from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

3. OpenCV 3.4.1. Download from [here](https://opencv.org/releases.html).

1. How to Set-up Visual Studio. In this tutorial, I describe how to download, install, and configure Visual Studio for C++ development. Watch the companion video [here]().  

2. How to Set-up OpenCV. In this tutorial, I describe how to download and set up OpenCV on Windows. Watch the companion video [here]().  

3. How to Configure a Visual Studio Project to Use OpenCV. In this tutorial, I describe how to configure a Visual Studio project to use OpenCV. Watch the companion video [here]().

4. An Introduction to OpenCV's Core Module. In this tutorial, I describe key aspects of OpenCV's core functionality. Watch the companion video [here]().

5. An Introduction to OpenCV's Image Processing Module. In this tutorial, I describe key aspects of OpenCV's image processing functionality. Watch the companion video [here]().

6. A General OpenCV Project. In this tutorial, I present a template for future OpenCV-based projects. Watch the companion video [here]().

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out my repository; I hope these tutorials, worksheets, and videos have helped you get started with OpenCV.
